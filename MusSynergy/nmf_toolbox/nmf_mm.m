% INPUT:
% X (N,M) : N (dimensionallity) x M (samples) non negative input matrix
% K       : Number of components
% maxiter : Maximum number of iterations to run
% speak   : prints iteration count and changes in connectivity matrix 
%           elements unless speak is 0
%
% OUTPUT:
% W       : N x K matrix
% H       : K x M matrix
